    <p>The purpose of the Information Systems Programming Club  

is to give students at UM-St. Louis real world examples of how technology is 

being applied in business applications, and to encourage and foster further 

understanding and knowledge of new developments in IS. These goals are accomplished through presentations and workshops on current 
  
  topics by guest speakers from industry, site visits to leading software development companies, 
  
  programming contests, and networking.</p>
<p>The ISPC has received a great deal of support from industry. We hope 
  
  to expand and strengthen our cooperation with local businesses to give IS students 
  
  at UM - St. Louis an opportunity to learn about exciting new technologies 
  
  directly from the companies that develop them.</p>
