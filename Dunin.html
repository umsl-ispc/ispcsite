              <p>Speaker:  Ms. Elonka Dunin, Executive Producer and General Manager of Online Community,  Simutronics Corporation<br>
              Topic: <em>Kryptos:</em> <em>The Unsolved Enigma at the center of CIA Headquarters</em></p>
              <p><strong>Abstract<br>
                </strong>At  the center of CIA Headquarters is a sculpture entitled Kryptos.&nbsp;With  hundreds of characters carved into copper sheets, it carries a series of  ciphers. Three of the four have been solved, but the fourth, a section with 97 characters  at the very bottom, remains uncracked, and remains one of the most famous  unsolved codes in the world. Cryptographer Elonka Dunin (namesake for the  &quot;Nola Kaye&quot; character in Dan Brown's novel &quot;The Lost  Symbol&quot;), one of the few people from outside the CIA to have seen the  sculpture in person, will speak about the parts that have been solved, the  famous unsolved section, and the process of solving other encrypted sculptures  created by the same artist, Jim Sanborn.<br>
