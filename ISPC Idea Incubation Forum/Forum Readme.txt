To start with let me introduce myself my name is Phil Zahniel I am the UMSL ISPC webmaster form
Beginning of spring semester 2015-end of fall 2015.  I was responsible for the website redesign that
brought our ISPC site to HTML5/CSS3 and responsive design from our previous HTML4 design, though I keep the previous
structure and elements,(http://web.archive.org/web/20131006092800/http://www.umsl.edu/studentlife/misclub/)
so thank you to those that came before me, and I hope that whomever succeeds me will take what I have and make it better.

The reason I created this directory is because I was hoping that future ISPC web masters,
and interested ISPC members that wanted to learn/collaborate would have a place to share front-end design ideas and code.
Like advanced animations(script or stylesheet) that could eventually be incorporated into the site or other projects.
 
Sorry future ISPC members, but my other hobby/interest is linguistics I choose to call this a forum, which is a loan word from latin
meaning a "public outdoor place".  Since it is on the internet it isn't really outdoors, but I wanted this to be a public and open
place to exchange ideas and learn from others.  If someone in the future decides to change the name from "ISPC Idea Incubation Forum",
I hope they keep the open forum aspect alive(I know my business professors might disagree, but not all code should need to be monetized)

Also it is part of the ispcsite public git repo so these ideas are to be available to the
world.  Lets create a space that others will draw inspiration from and that we can be proud of.
