                Currently membership is open to all UM-St. Louis students, faculty, alumni and other
                individuals. After a long hiatus the club has been revived by a few enthusiastic professors and students in the fall of 2014.
                We are always looking for new members and participants eager to learn and contribute.  Also we will be looking for new officer
                candidates to continue the club after the graduation of our current officers.
                To be a part of the Club, please contact any of our officers via email, or at one of our meetings.
