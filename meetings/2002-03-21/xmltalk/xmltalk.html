Simple book XML document example:


<a href="xmltalk/book.xml">book.xml</a><br>


XSL Stylesheet to use to display book.xml as a html page:


<a href="xmltalk/book.xsl">book.xsl</a><br>


Example of book.html with a document type declaration:


<a href="xmltalk/bookwithdtd.xml">bookwithdtd.xml</a><br>


The corresponding DTD:


<a href="xmltalk/book.dtd">book.dtd</a><br>


Example of book.html with a schema:


<a href="xmltalk/bookwithxsd.xml">bookwithxsd.xml</a><br>


The corresponding XML Schema:


<a href="xmltalk/book.xsd">book.xsd</a><br>


A larger document with numerous "book" nodes from the previous example:


<a href="xmltalk/library.xml">library.xml</a><br>


XSL Stylesheet to use to display library.xml as a html page:


<a href="xmltalk/library.xsl">library.xsl</a><br>


Same as library.xml only with an added date field:


<a href="xmltalk/library2.xml">library2.xml</a><br>


A more complex XSL Stylesheet with numerous xsl templates.  Also is an example of using


XPath to manipulate data inside nodes.  This example manipulates the date field that was


added in library2.xml. Also is an example of using variables in xsl:


<a href="xmltalk/library2.xsl">library2.xsl</a><br>

<em>Note about viewing xml files in a web browser:</em><br>


All xml files can be viewed by using IE 5.0+, Netscape 4.x will ask you to download them, and


Netscape 6+ / Mozilla will allow you to view them by using "View Source".<br>


DTD files will not be displayed correctly in a browser, you will have to download them.
