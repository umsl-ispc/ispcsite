<p class="title">09/14/1999</p>

<p>More than 30 students and faculty members attended the second meeting of the 

Club on September 14, 1999. The second meeting was dedicated to a discussion of 

Microsoft's COM/DCOM technologies. Needles to say, it was quite natural that the 

presentation on this topic was given by one of the best specialists in this 

field - Mark Bramer from Microsoft.</p>

<p>Mark first presented the theoretical foundations of COM/DCOM technologies an 

d answered questions from the audience. His presentation was followed by an 

actual demonstration of COM principles: Mark created a working COM application 

from scratch, proving that this technology is accessible to everybody who wants 

to use it.</p>

<p>Brian Lawton - the president of the Club presented Mark with a UM-St. Louis 

T-shirt and Mark promised to do his best in promoting our school at Microsoft . 

The meeting concluded with a popular tradition: a giveaway of Microsoft 

souvenirs and software.</p>

<p>So, what is COM and DCOM?<br>

The Component Object Model (COM) is a component software architecture that 

allows applications and systems to be built from components supplied by 

different software vendors. COM is the underlying architecture that forms the 

foundation for higher-level software services, like those provided by OLE. OLE 

services span various aspects of component software, including compound 

documents, custom controls, inter-application scripting, data transfer, and 

other software interactions.</p>

<p>These services provide distinctly different functionality to the user; 

however, they share a fundamental requirement for a mechanism that allows binary 

software components, supplied by different software vendors, to connect to and 

communicate with each other in a well-defined manner.</p>

<p align="center">

<img border="0" src="mtn2comppr_1.gif" width="394" height="320"></p>

<p>This mechanism is supplied by COM, a component software architecture that: 

Defines a binary standard for component interoperability <br>

Is programming language-independent <br>

Is provided on multiple platforms (Microsoft\256 Windows\256, Microsoft Windows 

NT™, Apple\256 Macintosh\256, UNIX\256) <br>

Provides for robust evolution of component-based applications and systems <br>

Is extensible </p>

<p>In addition, COM provides mechanisms for the following: Communications 

between components, even across process and network boundaries <br>

Shared memory management between components <br>

Error and status reporting <br>

Dynamic loading of components <br>

It is important to note that COM is a general architecture for component 

software. While Microsoft is applying COM to address specific areas such as 

controls, compound documents, automation, data transfer, storage and naming, and 

others, any developer can take advantage of the structure and foundation that 

COM provides.<br>
