<p class="title">10/27/1999</p>

<p>The October 27 meeting started with a surprise: our guest speaker from IBM, 

who was scheduled to talk about CORBA, had an urgent client engagement and 

wasn't able to present that night. The officers of the Club were informed about 

4 hours before the presentation and it looked like the meeting wasn't going to 

happen...</p>

<p>Brian Lawton - the president of ISPC - showed a lot of creativity and used h 

is vast technical skills to prepare a presentation on Active Server Pages 

technology.</p>

<p>Considering the very short notice that Brian had to prepare, the presentation 

that he gave was a huge success. We'd like to thank all of our club members who 

showed their support and understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>Even though our scheduled speaker wasn't there, we still had some fun give-aways 

for our members as you can see on the pictures below.</p>

<p>Why did Brian present ASP? What is ASP?</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="mtn3brian.jpg" width="450" height="404"></p>

<p align="center">Brian Lawton gives an impromptu presentation on ASP.</p>

<p>Active Server Pages is Microsoft's response to the needs of those webmasters 

who want to make their pages live and interactive without having to do tedious 

CGI programming and learn new scripting languages.</p>

<p>Based on VBScript, ASP technologies allows you to create intelligent website 

s with database websites much easier than &quot;traditional&quot; technologies. The 

learning curve to master basic ASP techniques is minimal, software to learn and 

implement ASP software components is available for free from Microsoft's 

website.</p>

<p>All these facts make ASP a very viable Internet technology and a &quot;must-have&quot; 

skill for webmasters. A large number of websites implement ASP, starting at 

Microsoft (&quot;we have to eat our own dog food&quot; said Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's 

President) and ending with many amateur home pages.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular opinion, ASP is a cross-platform technology. It can r un 

on non-Microsoft web-servers using third-party ASP scripting tools, such as one 

produced by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chilisoft.net/">Chili!Soft Inc.</a> 

If you think that hosting your website on an NT server is expensive, it'll be 

good news for you that NT web-hosting plans are priced in the same range as 

traditional Unix hosting. Most of g. Most of those plans allow you to put your 

MS Access database online without any additional charges.</p>
